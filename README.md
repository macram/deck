Simple app to shuffle cards in a Spanish deck and get them one at a time. 

It's the simplest app I could develop in a night. It should work in any Windows Phone 8 smartphone and it should work fast as a lightning.

This code is the source code of the app available [at the Windows Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=7f486d94-67db-4508-86d5-682067e01d2a).
